## English

### About

This project is an **unofficial fork** of [SharpEmu](https://github.com/sharpemu/sharpemu), created only as a **proof of concept for ARM64 devices**, with initial support focused on **Android ARM64**.

This ARM64 version is still at a very early experimental stage. It requires **a lot of additional development, testing, and optimization** before it can become practical on ARM64 devices.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The original **SharpEmu team has no affiliation, involvement, responsibility, or official connection with this ARM64 fork**. Please do not contact the original SharpEmu developers for support related to this version.

### Current Status

At the moment, the only tested game that reaches a boot state is **Dreaming Sarah**.

It is **not playable**.

This proof of concept currently uses an **adapted interpreter created mainly to make Dreaming Sarah boot** and validate the initial ARM64 approach. It should not be considered a complete or optimized CPU backend.

### Development Status

Development of this project will remain **paused** until my other port, **rpPS4**, based on [shadPS4](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadps4), becomes sufficiently solid and functional.

The ARM64 backend developed for **rpPS4** is planned to be reused as the foundation for the CPU/backend work in this unofficial SharpEmu ARM64 port.

For now, this repository should be treated strictly as an **early proof of concept**.
